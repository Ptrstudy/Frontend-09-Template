Study Notes

I learned a lot about pathfinding approaches, but it's never been as simple as this time. We don't need to care about the formulas, and we don't prove which solution is better. We just code for FUN!.

I've learned from this week's course:
- The more examples about the await and async functions; (Still need to understand more)
- The "get prototype" syntax for a new prototype, such as "get length(){}"
- The way we're avoiding unnecessary calculation, such as the heuristic function (compare function);
- The events that related to this assignment: mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, and the right-click.
